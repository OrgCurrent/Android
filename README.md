### Made With...

Happy Meter was developed using the MEAN stack, starring:

#### [The Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/) 

The beautiful, open source front-end framework for developing hybrid mobile apps with HTML5.

#### [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/): 

(from "humongous") An open-source document database, and the leading NoSQL database.

#### [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/): 

A minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and     multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

#### [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/): 

A structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend          HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly.

#### [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/): 

A platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses    an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time    applications that run across distributed devices.

With a guest appearance by:

#### [D3.js](http://d3js.org/):

A JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG and CSS.

### Codebase

The back-end Expressjs and Mongoose code can be found in the server folder. 

The front-end Angular.js and D3.js code can be found in the www/modules folders. The front-end folder structure is modularized by ui-router state, i.e. an Angular controller and html template combination, usually pertaining to a specific section of the app flow.
